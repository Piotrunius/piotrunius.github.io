## 7. Configure Notifications (Optional)

### Discord Notifications

1. Create a webhook in Discord:
   - Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook
   - Copy the webhook URL

   - Apps → Incoming Webhooks → Add to Slack
   - Copy the webhook URL
2. Add to repository secrets as `SLACK_WEBHOOK`
3. Uncomment Slack notification steps in workflows

## 8. Create Initial Branches

If you don't have a `dev` branch yet:

```bash
# Create dev branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b dev
git push origin dev

# Note: Check each command for errors before proceeding
```

## 9. Test the Setup

### Test Production Workflow

```bash
# Make a small change to main
echo "# Test" >> test.md
git add test.md
git commit -m "test: verify workflow"
git push origin main

# Monitor the workflow run
gh run watch
```

### Test Development Workflow

```bash
# Make a change to dev
git checkout dev
echo "# Dev Test" >> test-dev.md
git add test-dev.md
git commit -m "test: verify dev workflow"
git push origin dev

# Check Actions tab for workflow run
```

### Test Feature Workflow

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/test dev
echo "# Feature Test" >> test-feature.md
git add test-feature.md
git commit -m "test: verify feature workflow"
git push origin feature/test

# Create PR to dev
gh pr create --base dev --head feature/test

# Check Actions tab and PR for checks
```

## 10. Verify Security Scanning

1. Go to **Security** tab
2. Check:
   - **Dependabot alerts** - Should show any dependency vulnerabilities
   - **Code scanning alerts** - Should show CodeQL findings
   - **Secret scanning alerts** - Should show any exposed secrets

## 11. Monitor Health Checks

1. Wait for the hourly health check to run
2. Check **Actions** tab for `Health Check & Monitoring` workflow
3. Verify it completes successfully
4. Check that no issues were created (means site is up)

## 12. Troubleshooting

### Workflows Not Running

**Check**:
- Workflow files are in `.github/workflows/`
- YAML syntax is valid
- Triggers are configured correctly
- Actions are enabled in repository settings

**Solution**:
```bash
# Validate workflow syntax
gh workflow list

# Manually trigger workflow
gh workflow run main.yml
```

### Permissions Errors

**Check**:
- Workflow permissions are set to "Read and write"
- Tokens have necessary scopes
- Environment protection rules aren't blocking

**Solution**:
1. Go to Settings → Actions → General
2. Set workflow permissions to "Read and write"
3. Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

### Pages Deployment Fails

**Check**:
- GitHub Pages is enabled
- Source is set to "GitHub Actions"
- No conflicting branch configuration

**Solution**:
1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Under Source, select "GitHub Actions"
3. Save and re-run workflow

### Security Scans Fail

**Check**:
- Dependencies are up to date
- No critical vulnerabilities
- CodeQL supports your code

**Solution**:
```bash
# Update dependencies
npm update

# Fix vulnerabilities
npm audit fix

# Commit changes
git add package*.json
git commit -m "fix: update dependencies"
git push
```

## 14. Additional Configuration

### Custom Domain

If using a custom domain:

2. Add your custom domain
3. Configure DNS records:
   ```
   A     @     185.199.108.153

   A     @     185.199.110.153
   A     @     185.199.111.153
   CNAME www   piotrunius.github.io
   ```
4. Wait for DNS propagation
5. Enable HTTPS

### Subdomain for Dev Environment

To use dev.yourdomain.com for development:

1. Add CNAME record:
   ```
   CNAME dev   piotrunius.github.io
   ```
2. Configure in GitHub Pages (if available)
3. Or use Cloudflare Pages for dev branch

## 15. Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the [Troubleshooting](./CI-CD.md#troubleshooting) section
2. Review workflow logs in Actions tab
3. Search existing issues in the repository
